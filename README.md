This projects implements and compares the performance of classical ML algorithms (SVM, DecisionTree, RandomForest, XgBoost) and the TESS CTL catalog selection algorithm on identifying strong exoplanet candidates.
For feature selection extensive EDA is performed, and the performance is compared using percentage of confirmed exoplanets (found using NASA Exoplanet Archive) in positive flagged candidates by the algorithm.
